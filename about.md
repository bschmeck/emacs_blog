I have been using Emacs as my primary editor since August of 2001.  I started using Emacs for a very simple reason: MIT's Athena machines included it as an icon in the dock, making it the easiest text editor to launch.

Emacs has been my primary editor for all languages other than C#, but almost everything I know about it has come from self-initiated research.  Asking "How can I do X?" or "Is it possible to do Y?"  I went a very long time without venturing beyond the basic Emacs commands (splitting a window, query-replace, etc.) and my .emacs file had only a few lines (most of which I copied and pasted without understanding.)

At this point, I am primarily a Ruby (and Ruby on Rails) developer and the majority of my Emacs customizations are geared towards making that easier.

I hope to do two things with this blog:

* Describe how I currently use Emacs

* Explore new features (ido-mode, projectile, etc.) and try to fit them into my day-to-day use of Emacs
